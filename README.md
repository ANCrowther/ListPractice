# ListPractice

## GOAL
Practice C++ skills using Factory Pattern to create different types of lists. While I was able to make Node inheritance classes work with the Factory Pattern, it did leave me with using previous and next pointers (instead of left/right pointers) for the BST nodes. The BST breadth-first printing still needs work. It displays the nodes on the correct levels, just have to improve the spacing between the nodes.

## CURRENT LISTS
- Single Linked List
- double Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
